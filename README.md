# Team UNL - Major Chooser

This repository hosts artifacts related to our term project for the summer offering of CSCI 4830. The project itself is a basic web app that helps users explore some of the majors offered at UNL. For users who are unsure of what major they want to pursue, a 28-question quiz can be taken that recommends a possible major based on their responses to each prompt. More information on each major is also offered below the quiz for users interested in learning more about any potential fields.
